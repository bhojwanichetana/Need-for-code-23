                Labrador Worth Six Lakhs Found Dead; Ex-Owner Accused Of Murder

                A Labrador dog was found murdered brutally in the Karnal district of Haryana, and a case has been
                registered by his owner at the Karnal police station. According to the grieving owner, the previous
                owner of the lab (whom he had named Chhota Raja) was the one responsible for the murder of his dog, who
                was reportedly worth around six lakh rupees.

                The dog was kidnapped a few days ago. Sagar told the media that he suspects that the dog’s food was
                laced with drugs, as a result of which he lost consciousness, after which the kidnappers took him away.
                The dog’s body was found in a bad condition, leading the police to believe that he had been at the
                receiving end of a brutal thrashing by the people who killed him.


                Sagar and his friends have started a campaign to bring the matter to light and to punish the brutal
                killers of his beloved Chhota Raja. The police have registered a case against the culprits.

              At ‘KHOJ’ , we beleive that each and every pet deserves a roof over its head and proper medical assistance.
              We are a non profit organisation working for the wellbeing of pet animals . In the last year we saved around 860
              pets from dying and out of them 552 were adopted by people.

              Our organisation has made  collaborations with various NGOs working in the similar field and are expanding 
              each day.
              We are 24/7 online for the safety of animals

            <p>
              We are helping to stop cruelity towards animals in the following ways-: <br>
              We are rescuing the animals if the animals are injured or ill and give them proper medicine and proper
              treatment. <br>We give proper shelter for the animals so that they can stay comfortably.
              <br>Proper food and diet is provided so that animals will be healthy and do not fall ill in
              the further life. <br> We recommend you to not buy a pet from a pet store or a breeder ,instead adopt one from an
              animal shelter or adoption center. If you are really kind hearted, just pick up a pup on the side of the
              street and take him home. <br> Take a dog from the street into your own home. If that is not possible, try taking
              care of his food, medicines and vaccination.
